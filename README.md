Hotel Booking Trends and Revenue Analysis for 2022

# Introduction

The hospitality industry is highly dynamic, with seasonal fluctuations and demand, customer prefrences, and competetive pricing stratergies. Analyzing historical data can help in improving occupancy rates, optimizing revenue and enhancing guest experiences.

Here we have AtliQ Grands who owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue.
